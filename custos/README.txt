About this module:
Custos is meant to be more of a heads up display and a keeper and protector for a g3n world.  Custos also provides all the fundamental metadata needed by g3n to be made manifest.  So, it really is a keeper and protector of metadata.  It alone has direct access to the secrets necessary to provide metadata to the g3n rendering world.  You should be able to manipulate things in the collaborating g3n world using the headsup display generated by custos.  Custos is implemented in fyne.
